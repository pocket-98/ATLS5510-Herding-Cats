<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>a. Motivation</p>
<p>The goal of this project was to create an augmented reality game that
utilizes the Meta Quest 3's capabilities. We wanted to explore the
potential of AR in gaming and how it can enhance user experience. The
idea of herding cats was chosen as a fun and engaging concept that would
allow us to experiment with the technology while having simple
interaction and mechanics.</p>
<br/>

<p>b. What Was Built</p>
<p>In our VR game, Herding Cats, cats continuously appear on a table and
begin crawling toward the edges. The player's objective is to grab and
pull them back to the center to keep them from falling off. The game
features a scoring system that tracks how many cats you successfully
manage.</p>

<h2 id="3-implementation">3. Implementation</h2>
<p>a. How the Project Was Built</p>
<p>The game was built in Unity 5 with C# using the Meta SDK and the Meta
Quest 3. We also utililze the Mixed Reality Utility Kit (MRUK) to make
calculations about the physical environment. We used github so that
everyone could work on different parts independently and sync things
up.</p>

<p>b. Design Process and Ideation</p>
<p>We started by making sure that everyone was able to build the Meta
Quest app for android in Unity through the git repository and that we
could all make changes to a basic AR app without things breaking between
computers. This was quite the challenge because some of our development
machines were incapable of building without errors, so we had to pivot
from using Unity 6 to Unity 5.</p>
<p>We then formed different specialties between debugging, designing,
integration, modeling/animation, and coding.</p>
<p>Specifically for modeling the cat, Blender was used to create a cat
model. This involved making a very high polygon mesh and doing a
retopology down to a lower poly mesh. The Mesh was UV unwrapped to allow
for texturing and. The model was then rigged and animated using
Blender's animation tools and Inverse Kinematics for realistic movement.
The animation was exported as a .fbx file and imported into Unity. The
cat model was then set up with a simple animation controller to allow
for basic movement and idle animations.</p>
<p>For creating the environment for the game, custom scripts had to be
made to determine the largest surface for which to then add rigid body,
collision, and physics to. Also the player's 3D position had to be
captured to allow for the scoreboard to appear in the correct position
to be viewed while playing. Controlling the cats ragdoll physics also
required some custom scripts for handling rotation and movement as the
cats were potentially picked up and placed back on the table. The cat's
had autonomy when spawned to walk towards the edge of the table which
tied into the mechanism for ending the game when the player could no
longer stop the cats from walking over the edge.</p>
<h2 id="4-future-work">4. Future Work</h2>
<p>There are different areas where the game could be improved. More
animation states could be added such as a pick up animation. There were
problems with importing the rigging from Blender into Unity, so
approaching this in a more compatible way would be ideal.</p>
<p>For the gameplay itself, there is room to improve on the walking
logic for the cats and also to add in a dedicated start and menu screen
for difficulty settings to be able to control the rate of cats spawning
and the speed at which they walk. The game could also be improved by
adding a timer to the game to make it more competitive and
challenging.</p>
<p>The game AI for cat behavior could be iterated upon to determine
which direction of walking would make the game the most difficult for
the player. There is also the possiblity of making the game multiplayer
allowing for multiple people to try to manage all of the cats or maybe
having a mechanism where the goal is to have as many cats on one
player's side of the table before the time runs out.</p>
