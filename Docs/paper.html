<p>a. Motivation</p>
<p>The goal of this project was to create an augmented reality game that
utilizes the Meta Quest 3's capabilities. We wanted to explore the
potential of AR in gaming and how it can enhance user experience. The
idea of herding cats was chosen as a fun and engaging concept that would
allow us to experiment with the technology while having simple
interaction and mechanics.</p>
<br/>

<p>b. What Was Built</p>
<p>In our VR game, Herding Cats, cats continuously appear on a table and
begin crawling toward the edges. The player's objective is to grab and
pull them back to the center to keep them from falling off. The game
features a scoring system that tracks how many cats you successfully
manage. The game was built in Unity 5 with C# using the Meta SDK and the
Meta Quest 3. We also utililze the Mixed Reality Utility Kit (MRUK) to
make calculations about the physical environment.</p>
